# Machine Learning for Character Animation DEMO
The results from Machine Learning training a NN with animations are 
demonstrated through Unity integration.
Given a trajectory and a speed required by a user, the character 
automatically performs a suitable animation, fulfilling these 
requirements while automatically adjusting the speed and direction. 
Developed by IKinema in the context of the SAUCE project.

Clone the current repository and run the build.exe to open the demo.
