</br>

The results from Machine Learning training a NN with animations are 
demonstrated through Unity integration.
Given a trajectory and a speed required by a user, the character 
automatically performs a suitable animation, fulfilling these 
requirements while automatically adjusting the speed and direction. 
Developed by IKinema in the context of the SAUCE project.
